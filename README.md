# AYTO-Match-Explorer
### Kayla Beckham - 2019
Explore the data of matching ceremony partners, beam counts, truth booth results, and hypothetical perfect matches for Are You The One? Season 8.

## Run
Download the project. Run by calling vis.py in the cli. Profit. (but not really profit)

## This is the Minimum Viable Product for AYTO Match Explorer. 
Contains data from the first 6 episodes of Season 8 in the /res folder. 
You can toggle between weeks to see which matches happened together and how many beams appeared. 
The logic exists to propose hypothetical matches but the UI does not.
One hypothetical match was added programatically in vis.py. 

## TODO: 
* package this so the dependencies aren't awful, I'm so sorry.
* add UI to add hypothetical perfect matches and add logic to undo selecting a perfect match.
* create a dist version and tweet it at danny the software developer
* Solve the puzzle before the season ends??
