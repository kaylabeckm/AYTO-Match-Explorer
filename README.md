Explore the data of matching ceremony partners, beam counts, truth booth results, and hypothetical perfect matches for Are You The One? Season 8.

## This is the Minimum Viable Product for AYTO Match Explorer. 
Contains data from the first 7 episodes of Season 8 in the /res folder. 
You can toggle between weeks to see which matches happened together and how many beams appeared. 
You can select hypothetical perfect matches from a drop down menu that dynamically updates to show only valid matches.
You can click on the matches you added to remove them from 'Perfect Matches' and try a different match.
The two officially confirmed perfect matches cannot be removed.

## Run
Download the project. Fix your dependencies probably. Run by calling vis.py in the cli. Profit. (but not really profit)
For example, from the root of my ATYO directory, I call 'python3 src/vis.py' to run the project.

## TODO: 
* package this so the dependencies aren't awful, I'm so sorry.
* tweet it at danny the software developer
* Solve the puzzle before the season ends??
